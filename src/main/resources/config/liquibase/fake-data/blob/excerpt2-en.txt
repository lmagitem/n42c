<p><b>Passion</b> (Greek <i>πάσχω</i> "to suffer, to be acted on"<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> and Late Latin (chiefly Christian<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>) <i>passio</i> "passion; suffering" (from Latin <i>pati</i> "to suffer"; participle: <i>passus</i>)) is a feeling of intense enthusiasm towards or compelling desire for someone or something. Passion can range from eager interest in or admiration for an idea, proposal, or cause; to enthusiastic enjoyment of an interest or activity; to strong attraction, excitement, or emotion towards a person. It is particularly used in the context of romance or sexual desire, though it generally implies a deeper or more encompassing emotion than that implied by the term <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lust">lust</a></i>.
