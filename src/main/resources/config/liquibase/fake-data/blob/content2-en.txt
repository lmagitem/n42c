<p><i>The standard definition for emotion is a "</i>Natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others". <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> <b>Emotion</b> <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>, William James describes emotions as "corporeal reverberations such as surprise, curiosity, rapture, fear, anger, lust, greed and the like." These are all feelings that affect our mental perception. Our body is placed into this latter state, which is caused by one's mental affection. This state gives signals to our body which cause <i>bodily expressions.</i>
</p>
<p>The philosopher <b>Robert Solomon</b> developed his own theory and definition of <i>emotion</i>. His view is that emotion is not a bodily state, but instead a type of judge. "It is necessary that we choose our emotions, in much the same way that we choose our actions"<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>  With regard to the relationship between emotion and our rational will, Solomon believes that people are responsible for their emotions. Emotions are rational and purposive, just as actions are. "We choose an emotion much as we choose a course of action."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Recent studies, also traditional studies have placed <b>emotions</b> to be a physiological disturbance.  William James takes such consciousness of emotion to be not a choice but a physical occurrence rather than a disturbance. It is an occurrence that happens outside of our control, and our bodies are just affected by these <i>emotions.</i> We produce these actions based on the instinctive state that these feelings lead us towards.

<p>This concept of emotion was derived from passion. Emotions were created as a category within passion.
