This is a small side project on which I work in my spare
time. [You can see the results by following this link](https://n42c.com). It is meant to replace
my [WordPress blog](https://n42c.net), while hosting alongside my portfolio/resume, a shop on which I could sell art
works of mine, and an application to manage long-run campaigns in the miniature wargame Warhammer 40000.

It was generated using [JHipster 6.9.1](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v6.9.1),
uses [Angular 9](https://v9.angular.io/docs) for its front-end and
a [Spring Boot 2.2.7](https://spring.io/blog/2020/05/07/spring-boot-2-2-7-available-now) server running
on [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java8.html) for its back-end. Data is stored on
a [PostgreSQL 12.3](https://www.postgresql.org/about/) relational database, with authentication data entrusted
to [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cognito/). The app is packaged by [Maven 3.3.9](https://maven.apache.org/),
and published as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image ran on a [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/ec2/) instance
behind a [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) proxy server. As you can see, it uses [git](https://git-scm.com/) for its
version control system with a repo hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/),
and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to run CI/CD pipelines.

This repo is open to the public mainly for showcase purposes, but feel free to contact me if you'd like to contribute on
anything.
